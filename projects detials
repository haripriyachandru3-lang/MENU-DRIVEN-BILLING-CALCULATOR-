This project is developed to create a menu driven billing calculator using Python.

The system allows users to perform different billing operations through a simple menu interface.

Users can enter the price and quantity of items to calculate the bill amount.

The calculator allows adding item costs to the total bill.

It also supports subtracting discounts from the total bill amount.

The program performs multiplication to calculate the cost based on item quantity.

The calculator can divide the total amount when required.

The billing amount is updated after each operation.

The menu is displayed repeatedly until the user chooses the exit option.

This project helps in understanding Python operators, user input, loops, and conditional statements.
